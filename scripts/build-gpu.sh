# Release build with GPU support, under a memory cap.
#
# Two reasons this exists as a script instead of a line in the README:
#
#   1. Without --features cuda the query embedding runs on CPU. bge-m3 is 568M
#      parameters and that alone takes cuba_faro's median from 0.451s to 4.23s
#      — 9.4x, on every single search. A plain `cargo build --release` silently
#      throws that away.
#   2. A release link with lto="fat" and codegen-units=1 pulls several GB at
#      once. Run unconstrained on a 14.9 GB laptop with editors open, it takes
#      the machine down; it has done so twice.
